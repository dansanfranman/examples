# examples

This project is not intended to be buildable and serves no purpose other than to showcase implementations of various systems in C#/.NET. The comments are meant as talking points for myself during the interview process and not necessarily for a fellow developer to follow.

Program.cs will contain my implementations. All other files are .NET generated code and should be ignored
